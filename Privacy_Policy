1. Introduction
At HomePal, we believe in a simple principle: your data is yours.
We built this platform with your privacy in mind — no surveillance, no hidden trackers, and no selling of your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what control you have over it.

2. Information We Collect
We only collect minimal and necessary information to provide the core functionality of the app. Here's what we collect:

a. Account Information
When you sign up: we collect your email address to create and manage your account.

b. Device Information (Non-identifiable)
We may collect non-identifiable device data (OS version, app version) to improve performance and debug issues. This data is not linked to your identity.

c. Optional Preferences
Settings you choose (e.g., notifications, theme preference) may be stored locally or tied securely to your account.

3. What We Do Not Do
❌ We do not track your browsing behavior outside the app
❌ We do not use third-party analytics that profile or fingerprint you
❌ We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to advertisers or marketers
❌ We do not collect unnecessary background data

4. How We Use Your Information
We use your email only to operate and improve the app, including:

- Creating and managing your account
- Allowing you to join or create households
- Sending essential notifications (e.g., invitations, reminders)
- Improving app reliability and performance

5. Data Sharing
We do not share your email or any data with third-party advertisers or data brokers.

We may share data only in the following cases:
- With your consent (e.g., when inviting another user to your household)
- For legal reasons, if required to comply with law enforcement or legal obligations
- With service providers directly involved in operating the platform (e.g., secure cloud storage), under strict confidentiality

9. Security
We use industry-standard encryption and access controls to protect your email and data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
